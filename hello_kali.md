# HELLO_KALI #

I have successfully installed *Kali*, here, I am going to mark down my experience of learning to use it.



## Use Git On Kali ##

It amazed me that with *Kali*, people don't use app stores to download applications, instead, **they use the *terminal* to download things like this: `apt-get install git`. After a few minutes, nothing happened, and it is said that, in Linux, happening nothing is the best thing. **
Then I found that I couldn't get my markdown from the *Github*. By checking the *Github.com*, I reallized that my uploading on *Windows* must be unsuccessful. So I checked the course and found that **when the users `git add example.example`, the file isn't uploaded to the repository, and the users `git commit -m "example"` the file is then uploaded to the local repository . Only when you use `git push origin master` the files are uploaded**
Soon, I got my markdowns on the *Kali*. However, another problem accured -- I could't open the files with *.md*. **So, I went to the *www.markdown.cn* (though I think it's not an official webside), and found that the *ReText* may help me. ** Without difficulty, my problem solved again.

## Trouble Is A Friend ##
<!-- as today I am to busy and it's late night now, so I am going to cut my markdown for today down.-->
Then to type in Chinese, **I downloaded the *Fcitx* and the *GooglePinYin* .** And to download *Wechat*(of course not official version), I downloaded the *Snap*, **BUT THERE ISN'T A *WECHAT* IN *SNAP*. **

## The Branch ##

<!-- This paragraph is going to markdown what I learnt of *Git* and *GitHub* today. -->

It is said that I'd better use the *branch* function to update my git code. Because it is safer and very convenient. But to be honest, it was a little bit difficult for me to understand and remember so much noun and command. And finally, by doing test, I found that **I almost need to give a command of uploading my local change after I do every thing. So, DON'T FORGET TO `git push <...>`!**
