# HELLO_KALI #

I have successfully installed *Kali*, here, I am going to mark down my experience of learning to use it.



## Install Git ##

It amazed me that with *Kali*, people don't use app stores to download applications, instead, they use the *terminal* to download things like this: `apt-get install git`. After a few minutes, nothing happened, and it is said that, in Linux, happening nothing is the best thing.
